# IID-MEF for Sequence-Image Fusion
This is an extension example of the proposed IID-MEF to handle multi-exposure sequences containing 3 images. Of course, it can be further extended to handle multi-exposure sequences containing a larger number of images, but you need to slightly mofify the code and perform retraining.
